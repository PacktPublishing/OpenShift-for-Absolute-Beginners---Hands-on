Setup VirtualBox
In the upcoming demo, we will be deploying Minishift using VirtualBox. If you are planning to follow along in your own setup and haven't setup already now would be a good time to download and install VirtualBox. We also have a video on setting up VirtualBox at the end of this course under APPENDIX D - Setup VirtualBox. If interested view that first and then resume here.
